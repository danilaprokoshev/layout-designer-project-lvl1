## About

[**Cognitive Biases**](http://wakeful-mint.surge.sh) is my educational project as a layout designer that I performed during the studying on [hexlet.io](https://ru.hexlet.io) (project level 1).

As developers, we’re familiar with the various problems that interfere with our productivity. But often we overlook the broad picture. Some subtle, some huge, some you can do something about, and some you just, well, can’t.

These all combine to form a sort of internal feedback loop that can lead to lost hours of productivity, bugs, and just all-around frustration. If we can minimize the impact of one or two of these, we can break the cycle and neutralize the rest. Here’s a list of 5 cognitive biases you should be aware of while programming:
* Hyperbolic Discounting
* IKEA Effect
* Premature Optimization
* Planning Fallacy
* Recency Bias
